# Drivers_Cash using MySQL 
A project to organize drivers' financial transactions in delivery offices, and easily display and organize drivers' data with an easy-to-use interface and a secure database.
note : you should make your local database and change its name in code .
# I use MySQL to manage database because of that you should create your own loccl database and rename it in the code.
## I will rebuild this desketop application with another user interface using ttkBootstrap library for design and using SQLight to enable application to create its own database on your computer.
