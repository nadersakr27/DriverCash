# Drivers_Cash 
A project to organize drivers' financial transactions in delivery offices, and easily display and organize drivers' data with an easy-to-use interface and a secure database.
# I used MySQL to manage database in this application, Because of that, you should create your own local database and rename it in the code.
I will rebuild this desketop application with another user interface using ttkBootstrap library for design and using SQLight to enable application to create its own database on your computer.
